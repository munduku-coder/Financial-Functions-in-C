# Financial-Functions-in-C

This repository contains a collection of C programs that solve real- world financial and computational problems using both **void functions** and **function that returns values** and cover a wide range of applications ,including salary calculations, loan payments , profit margin, depreciation, and more.

## 1.Queation number
This project addresses ****Bachelor of Science in Apllied Information Technology**** class activity week 6(functions).

## 2.Description
_**objective:**_
This project implements various financial calculations using **C programming functions** to reinforce the understanding of modular programming and function design.

_each task:_
1. Demonstrate the use of **Void functions** and **functions with returned values**.
2. Solve real-world problems using mathematical formulas.
3. Provides user-friedndly output for practical applications.

## 3.Installation steps
1. clone the repository
2. Compile any of the C files using C compiler
3. Run the compiled program

## 4.Usage
Run individual program to solve specific problems
_examples_

1. Calculate total cost

   Output: Display the total sale price after the discount
3. Calculate tax percentage

   Output: Display the applicable tax rate based on salary
5. Calculate break-even point

   Output: Display the number of units required to break even.

## 5.Features of the program
1. comprehensive financial calculations:

   Include profit margins, tax rates, Depreciation, and more. 
2. Modular design:

   Use both void functions and functions with returen values.
3. Flexible inputs:
   Allow user-defined inputs for dynamic calculations.
